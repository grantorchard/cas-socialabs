We ask that you follow the provided headings for consistency between modules.

### Lab Objective
Describe what the purpose of the lab exercise is.

### Instructions
1. Use a numbered list to provide **guidance** but not step by step instructions.
2. We want people to feel a sense of accomplishment at figuing out how to do things within the platform.
3. If you think it will help, you can embed a gif or youtube video with the following syntax to take advantage of the lightbox. {% lightbox /assets/images/03.png --title="Start the lab" --alt="Using Cloud Assembly Blueprints" --data="getting-started" --img-style="max-width:80%" %}

### Hints
In this section you can provide examples, hints, or links that will assist people who might be struggling to progress.
You can use ```three backticks``` to provide code block formatting, or create a gist with {% gist gist_id %}.

### Solution
Create an [alternate page](https://with-a-link)containing requisite YAML or code snippets in the event that people get stuck. This is an optional section that may not apply to all lessons.
