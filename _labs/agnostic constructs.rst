Lab 01. Projects and Agnostic Constructs
****************************************

Different organisations have different models by which they operate. In fact, in a lot of organisations multiple models of operation are running concurrently. Do you use a share vCenter for your private cloud workloads? What about AWS accounts - one per organisation, or one per project?
Projects are the way that we make sure people are using the right set of infrastructure services. This could be through the use of explicitly mapping Cloud Zones to a given project, or through the application of Constraints to inform the placement algorithm in a desired manner.

Agnostic constructs are the means by which we map the specific details of an image, flavor, storage, or network through to a reusable common name.
