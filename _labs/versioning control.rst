Lab 03. Leveraging Version Control
**********************************

Integrate with GitHub
=====================

To begin, click on the Infrastructure tab to get started.

1.  Click on the **Integrations** item from the left menu
2.  Click on the **Add Integrations** button
3.  Click on the **GitHub** tile
4.  For **Token** copy & paste ```5e99999c7bf6a5ee5 4939a88608c23c143041db0``

.. note:: Remove any spaces from the token value, you may need to copy the token first into a text editor to remove the spaces. A space was added intentionally to workaround GitHub's security measures. Publishing a token on GitHub's Repository is not recommended!

5.  Click on the **Validate** button
6.  For **Name** type *SociaLabs*
7.  Click on the **Add** button
