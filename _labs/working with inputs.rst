Lab 04. Working with Inputs
***************************

There are advanced Cloud Assembly blueprint code possibilities that can take a simple blueprint to the next level, we'll explore them in this lab.

.. note:: Whenever you see #TODO in a code sample, you need to replace the line with the appropriate syntax. Refer to the linked documents if you need assistance.


Blueprint Inputs
================
You use input parameters so that users can make custom selections at request time. Inputs are a mechanism for assigning variables to blueprint components at request time. Inputs support a number of different data types such as strings, integers, numbers, boolean, and objects.

You'll now need clone the **Basic IaaS** blueprint to **Basic IaaS with Inputs** to get started.

Create Blueprint Inputs
-----------------------
You may have noticed ``inputs: {}`` in the YAML previously, this is where we add blueprint inputs.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 2

    formatVersion: 1
    inputs: {}

1.  Remove the curly brackets from ``inputs: {}``, start a new line and notice how it auto intents
2.  Enter the input **Name** ``tshirtsize:`` and hit 'Enter' again
3.  Enter the input **Type** ``type: string``

Use Blueprint Inputs
--------------------
Similar to coding or scripting we use inputs like variables.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 13

    formatVersion: 1
    version: 1.0
    name: Basic IaaS with Inputs
    formatVersion: 1
    inputs:
      tshirtsize:
        type: string
    resources:
    machine:
      type: Cloud.Machine
      properties:
      image: ubuntu
      flavor: #TODO configure the blueprint to use the input
      constraints:
        - tag: 'platform:aws'

1.  Replace the value ``medium`` in the YAML with `${input.tshirtsize}`

Deploy Blueprint
----------------

1.  Click on the **Deploy** button down below
2.  For **Deployment Name** type *basic aws*
3.  For **Deployment Inputs** type *medium*
4.  Click on the **Deploy** button
5.  After a few minutes the deployment should be complete, click on the deployment name to view more details about the components

Challenge
=========

1.  Create a input for different platforms, e.g. *AWS* and *Azure*
2.  Create a drop-down list for the platforms input to provide choice
3.  Create a friendly title for the platforms input to provide ease of use

As alluded to, a free form text field could lead to problems when a specific syntax is required. Also, 'tshirtsize' is not all that user friendly a field name. You should probably change that. What do you think would happen if you typed 'Small' instead of 'small'?

To assist with the above challenges refer to `How user input can customized <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Assembly/services/Using-and-Managing/GUID-6BA1DA96-5C20-44BF-9C81-F8132B9B4872.html>`__

Conclusion
==========

In this lab we took a look at how we can utilise inputs to provide simpler ways to consume blueprints as users typically you wouldn't expect majority of users to understand the exact inputs required.
