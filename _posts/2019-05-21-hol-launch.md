            This lab guide has been written specifically for the Cloud Automation Services SociaLabs. The purpose for a separate guide allows for closer alignment with demonstrations, use-case, event feedback and new Cloud Automation Services (CAS) feature releases. Although attendees will enrol and run HOL-1902-03-CMP, modules and use-cases will differ from the official lab guide. HOL-1902-03-CMP provides the necessary services, backend tenant, pre-configured logical constructs, pre-configured cloud endpoints, etc. required to successfully complete this lab.
