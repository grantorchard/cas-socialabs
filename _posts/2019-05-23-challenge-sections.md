### Each Objective will include a Challenge Section
These challenges are <b>optional</b> but strongly encouraged.
They have been written in a declaritive manner so you will need to think about how you can deliver a particular outcome. There may be multiple ways to get to this outcome. Feel free to ask questions as you go to the instructors. You will earn points throughout the day and the person with the most points wins a prize from VMware!!! Let you're instructors know once you have completed a challenge so they can confirm and take note.

<b>There will be prizes!</b>
