The Cloud Automation Services SociaLabs event was a brainchild of Grand Orchard, Brett Drayton, and Tony Phan. The three were original co-creators, co-authors of this lab guide and VMware, Inc. employees focusing on Cloud Automation. Almost all of them are still VMware employees but one, Brett has since moved on and is now focusing on Google Cloud.

The goal was to create an impactful experience with VMware's Cloud Automation Services and educate persons from all walks of life about Multi-Cloud Automation, Infrastructure-as-Code, Cloud Bootstrapping, Configuration Management, Extensibility, Pipelining, and much more.

The intention is for this content to be shared and evolved. We dig constructive feedback, ideas, and opinions. Issues can be created and tracked `here <https://github.com/grantorchard/cas-socialabs/issues>`__
