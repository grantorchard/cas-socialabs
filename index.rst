Getting Started
===============

.. important::

  This lab guide has been written specifically for the Cloud Automation Services SociaLabs. The purpose for a separate guide allows for closer alignment with demonstrations, use-case, event feedback and new Cloud Automation Services (CAS) feature releases. Although attendees will enrol and run HOL-1902-03-CMP, modules and use-cases will differ from the official lab guide. HOL-1902-03-CMP provides the necessary services, backend tenant, pre-configured logical constructs, pre-configured cloud endpoints, etc. required to successfully complete this lab.

Throughout the course, you will be asked to complete lab objectives that align with specific demonstrations and use-cases.
Before you get started, make sure you have an existing account for the VMware Hands-on Labs, if not follow the [registration steps](https://cas-socialabs.vmwapj.com/hol-registration/). Once registered or if you already have an existing account follow the [launch steps](https://cas-socialabs.vmwapj.com/hol-launch/) required for this course.
As part of the modules you will be asked to complete challenges. These are optional however it is suggested you attempt to complete these, we may give out a prize for the person who successfully completes the most. More information available on the [challenges](https://cas-socialabs.vmwapj.com/challenge/) page.
